This is a corpus of the work of Kitaoji Rosanjin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosanjin) based on the texts in Aozora Bunko (https://www.aozora.gr.jp/index_pages/person1403.html#sakuhin_list_1), annotated with Universal Dependencies in the format of CoNLL-U.

The texts were downloaded from the URL by "download_aozora_zip.py", and unzipped by "aozora_unzip_utf8.py", which also changes the encoding from Shift-JIS into UTF-8. The texts were parsed by a PowerShell command "merge-ginza-conllu.ps1".

All the notes, comments and rubies are not deleted and parsed as they are in the texts. Dependencies and labels are not corrected, neither manually nor automatically.
